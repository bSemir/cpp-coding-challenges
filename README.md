Here I push at least one algorithmic coding problem every (or every other) day until I learn the craft or until I go crazy :)
#
Using: C++ (14/17)
#
Covered the following topics so far:
- Vectors (std::vector)
- Arrays ("modern" array" std::array)
- arrays
- Strings (std::string)
- list (std::list)
- queue (std::queue)
- map (std::map)
- pointers, double pointers and pointer arithmetic
- smart pointers
- references
- anonymous functions (lambdas)
- dynamic memory allocation
- structs

OOP:
- classes
- constructors
- explicit constructors
- copy and move constructors
- copy and move assignment operators
- destructors
- operator overloading
- method overriding
- inheritance
- files (txt & bin)

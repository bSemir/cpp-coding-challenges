# Algorithmic Coding Challenges
Welcome to my algorithmic coding journey! Here, I aim to solve at least one coding problem every day (or every other day) until I master the craft or go crazy trying. 😄
#
### Language of Choice: C++
### C++ Standards: 14/17
#
## Topics Covered So Far
### Data Structures:
* Vectors (std::vector)
* Arrays (C-like arrays and std::array)
* Strings (std::string)
* Lists (std::list)
* Queues (std::queue, std::priority_queue)
* Maps (std::map)
* Sets (std::set)
* Stacks (std::stack)
### Additional Topics:
- Matrices
- Pointers (single, double, and pointer arithmetic)
- Smart Pointers
- References
- Anonymous Functions (Lambdas)
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Structs
### Object-Oriented Programming:
- Classes
- Constructors
- Explicit Constructors
- Copy and Move Constructors
- Copy and Move Assignment Operators
- Destructors
- Operator Overloading

### About this Repository
This repository is a collection of algorithmic problems I've tackled using C++. It serves as a way to track my progress, refine my skills, and maybe even help others who are on a similar path. Feel free to browse through the solutions, suggest improvements, or contribute your own!
